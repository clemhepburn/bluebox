    <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal webpage!<br />This is me, pictured above, in Big Sur, California.</p>
    <h1><em>Who are you? And what is this?</em></h1>
    <p>I am a 28 (almost 29) year old artist and undergraduate Architecture student. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p>I am an avid trail runner and adventure cyclist. I also love surfing and Nordic skiing. <br />I enjoy tennis, but I am not great at it. I love to go to baseball games.
    </p>
    <img class="album-art" src="./humanlearning.png" alt="The album art for my most recent cassette tape. It just says my name and the album title ('Human Learning'), and has an illustration of a man securing a very large flower with twine. The flower is taller than the man." />
    <p>I make experimental music which you could call "noise" or sometimes "prepared guitar" music. My most recent effort, "Human Learning" was released by Tapes Scree, a cassette tape record label in Seattle, Washington. You can listen to and purchase it <a href="https://tapesscree.bandcamp.com/album/human-learning">Here</a>.<br/><br />
    I haven't been playing shows lately, but I am open to it. I would really like to play shows and meet new friends in Europe, and especially in Norway and Sweden. If you can assist with making this a reality, please do get in touch.</p>

    <h3>I am in the midst of an effort to divest from social media (and smart phone ownership) entirely.</h3>
    <p>The reasons for doing so are ultimately probably boring, and I'm not sure anybody wants to read my clichÃ©, Luddite rant...<br/>But here are the main points, if you are curious:</p>
    <p class="list">
      <b>1.</b> Social media websites and applications are intentionally designed to be addictive and to make the user feel all kinds of bad feelings.<br/>
      <b>2.</b> I do not want to be constantly tracked and bombarded with advertisements, nor have my data bought and sold all over the place. <br/>
      <b>3.</b> Merely using these platforms gives money to people I don't want to give money to, if I can help it.<br/>
      <b>4.</b> These websites engineer social dynamics that are reactive and antagonistic, because those kinds of interactions trigger something in our puny brains which is very hard to resist engaging with -- engagement means money. I feel that these modes of interaction are ruthlessly destroying our sense of shared reality and essentially prodding our world to devolve into insanity.<br />
      <b>5.</b> I simply feel badly when I visit a website like Instagram. If I no longer feel a sense of enjoyment or utility, there's no reason for me to continue using it.<br />
      <b>6.</b> Lastly, my personal sense of well-being and mental clarity is much greater if I do not look at screens very much.
    </p>
    <p>So anyway, I am gathering contact information for people I've met through the internet, and planning to buy a Sunbeam Orchid flip phone soon. I have wanted one for a while, and my friend Ana has one. <br /><br />I am also looking into options to have a landline telephone as well... which seems kind of silly but also actually cool and fun.</p>
    <h3>Ok, enough of that.. si dramatique! Email me if you want to talk more about it. In other news:</h3>
    <img class="dandelion" src="./IMG_8036.jpg" alt="a handful of dandelion leaves in my hand, being washed in a steel sink of clear water." />
    <p>I am doing research on building a solar roaster, so that I can roast dandelion root using solar energy. I want to set up a dandelion tea booth at the Clark Park Farmer's Market. I admire the dandelion, and I like dandelion tea a lot. I took the photo above while harvesting dandelion leaves on an organic farm in Los Osos, California, where I briefly worked.<br />
    I am very inspired by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230308191556/http://dandelion.day/">Dandelion Cafe</a> project at UVT. (It appears their website is down, so this is a web archive link.)</p>
    <p>I am slowly but surely working on new music arrangements, but I am quite immersed in school, work, home, partnership, travel, social life.. I am working on finding time! </p>
    <p class="sign-off">That's all for now, I think..! <br />
    Logging off, <br/>
  Clem</p>
